Google Tag Manager is a tag management system that lets you configure and deploy tags on your website or mobile app, from an easy-to-use web interface. You can use Tag Manager to optimize your tag deployment, troubleshoot configuration errors, and modify tags that are already deployed.

## Why Use Google Tag Manager

Here are some reasons to use Tag Manager:

- Support for tag organization.
- Version control.
- Support for multiple tag types, including the Google tag.
- Community-developed tag templates.
- Enterprise collaboration.
- Security features.

## Deploy for Web Pages

Use Tag Manager to manage tags (such as measurement and marketing optimization JavaScript tags) on your site. Without editing your site code, use Tag Manager to add and update Google Ads, Google Analytics, Floodlight, and third-party tags.
